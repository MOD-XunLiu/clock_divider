1. Make software run good
   - Make uart to usb connection good, make uart appear on device manager first
     - Connect via UART port
     - Find the port in device manager
     - If driver not installed, [install driver](https://youtu.be/vuYs4A_kcsg?feature=shared)
     - Go to a [terminal emulation application](https://github.com/TeraTermProject/teraterm/releases/tag/v5.2), set the [correct baud rate](https://support.xilinx.com/s/feed/0D54U00008VPpkRSAT?language=en_US) and read message
2. Check the signals going correctly
   - Find the problematic signal and use oscillascope on it (+1 on pin, -1 on ground)
   - Check the voltage level (zynq board is 0 to 3.3V)
   - If the voltage level is inconsistent with the logic analyzer's level, [change it](https://youtu.be/UwYFnTbY-8k)
